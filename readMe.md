## General info

This simple and intuitive script allows you to use the **3D bin-packing simulation** in an easier way.
By writing the right keyword you can launch a certain action (like _create bin, add item, pack items_,..).
<br />
You can find the algorithm and objects (_Bin, Item, Item_List_) in \__3dbp.py_,
run _text_based_script.py_ for a simple **terminal UI** and
check _examples_ directory if you want to see some examples about how can you use the code in your projects.
<br />
The algorithm doesn't offer the **optimal solution** sometimes but the average wasted space is below 5% which is pretty good for my needs (given that it's a NP hard problem).

#### Graphical version

Also, I developed a graphic version of **3D bin-packing** that uses the algorithm mentioned above.
<br />

## Technologies

- Python 3.8.3
- Modules:
  - copy
  - math

## Setup

Bin and Items dimensions need to be positive integers.
<br />
_python text_based_script.py_ - to run the terminal UI

## Purpose

This open source project is meant to provide an approximately optimal solution for the 3D bin packing problem.
<br />
It can be used for various things:

- deposit space management
- cargo vehicle space management (keep in mind that this algorithm doesn't take into account the boxes weight)
- others (**Example**: I needed it for a game feature)

## Examples of use

You can see some example code in example scripts from **examples** directory.

<br />
But if you don't want to install the packages or to use the executable, you can represent the output data by yourself:
- Use pen and paper (kind of weird and not environmentally friendly:), I don't recommend)
- Use a 3D modeling web application (Example: [SketchUp](https://app.sketchup.com/app))
- Use some unusual ways (lego pieces, cubic shapes)
